This is a big smash up of a lot of various tools I have made in the past along with some new ones. It includes a array of tools for helping with pentesting and messing around on the net. Currently only have installer files made for Ubuntu & Debian systems, but if you know what you're doing you can easily read them and get what you need to get all the dependencies installed on your own.  I made a quick basic demonstration video you to give a general overview of what it has included, you can watch it here: http://youtu.be/z9rq1SBIYI0  Here is another short video to show how the Dorker piece works: http://youtu.be/43aphr0QRng  It's a bit of a constant work in progress but will be posting updates from time to time as I add more stuff and get them stabilized and working properly without much issue. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions just let me know.  Thanks, H.R.
